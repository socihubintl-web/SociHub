<h1>SociHub Platform Rules & Guidelines</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to SociHub! Our platform connects clients with earners and is managed by a team of administrators. These rules are designed to ensure a safe, productive, and fair environment for all users. Please read carefully before using the platform. By participating, you agree to comply with these guidelines.
  </p>
  <p>
    All participants, including earners, clients, and admins, are expected to uphold integrity, professionalism, and respect towards others. Violations of these rules may result in warnings, penalties, suspension, or permanent bans.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Rules for Earners</h2>
  <p>
    Earners are individuals who perform tasks, complete projects, or engage with client requests to earn rewards or payments. The following rules apply:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Earners must complete all tasks accurately and according to instructions provided by clients.</li>
    <li><strong>Timeliness:</strong> Submissions must be made within the agreed deadline. Late submissions may be rejected and flagged.</li>
    <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> Earners must provide genuine work. Plagiarism, copying, or submitting fraudulent content is strictly prohibited.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Promptly respond to client messages or platform notifications. Avoid ignoring queries or requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Security:</strong> Do not share your login credentials with anyone. Maintain strong passwords and secure your account.</li>
    <li><strong>File Standards:</strong> Submit work in the proper format requested (image, video, document). Malformed submissions may be rejected.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect Rules:</strong> Earners must respect clients, admins, and fellow earners. Harassment, offensive language, or hate speech is prohibited.</li>
    <li><strong>Flagging and Complaints:</strong> Do not attempt to bypass rules by falsely reporting clients. False complaints can result in penalties.</li>
    <li><strong>Fees and Rewards:</strong> Understand the platform fees and reward distribution. No off-platform payments should affect official earnings.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Suspension:</strong> Repeated violations, poor performance, or misconduct can lead to warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent account bans.</li>
  </ul>
    <li><strong>Possible Causes for Account Suspension or Ban:</strong>
  <p>Earners are expected to maintain integrity and professionalism on the platform. Repeated violations or serious offenses may result in flags, warnings, or permanent account suspension. Possible causes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Submitting Inaccurate Work:</strong> Delivering tasks that are incomplete, low-quality, or intentionally misleading.</li>
    <li><strong>Failure to Follow Task Instructions:</strong> Ignoring client guidelines or failing to adhere to task requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Late or Delayed Submissions:</strong> Consistently missing deadlines without valid justification.</li>
    <li><strong>Fraudulent Behavior:</strong> Using fake accounts, bots, scripts, or sharing unauthorized information to manipulate task results.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Flagged Tasks:</strong> Accumulating flagged tasks due to non-compliance, poor performance, or client complaints. Reaching a high flagged threshold (e.g., 3 or more critical flags) may trigger temporary suspension or permanent ban.</li>
    <li><strong>Disrespectful Communication:</strong> Using offensive language, harassment, or failing to respond professionally to clients or admins.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Sharing or Misuse:</strong> Allowing others to access your account or misusing the platform in ways that compromise security or fairness.</li>
    <li><strong>Violation of Platform Policies:</strong> Any activity that breaches the platform’s general terms of service, privacy policies, or community guidelines.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> All flagged tasks are reviewed by admins. Earners may appeal a flag if they believe it was unjustified, but repeated violations or severe misconduct can lead to account suspension or ban without appeal.</p>
</strong></li>
  <p>
    Earners are encouraged to build a reputation through consistent, high-quality work. Positive engagement increases your chances for higher rewards and priority task assignment.
  </p>

  <h2>Rules for Clients</h2>
  <p>
    Clients are individuals or organizations that post projects, tasks, or requests on the platform. These rules are designed to protect both clients and earners:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Project Clarity:</strong> Provide clear, complete, and detailed instructions for tasks or projects. Avoid vague requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Integrity:</strong> Ensure all payments, rewards, or project fees are available before confirming assignments.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect Earners:</strong> Treat earners professionally. Avoid offensive language, harassment, or inappropriate demands.</li>
    <li><strong>Timely Feedback:</strong> Approve or reject submissions promptly. Delayed feedback can affect earners’ workflow and platform fairness.</li>
    <li><strong>Project Rules Compliance:</strong> Ensure all posted tasks comply with platform rules and legal standards. Illegal or unethical requests are strictly prohibited.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Answer questions from earners or admins regarding project details. Miscommunication may result in project rejection.</li>
    <li><strong>Flagging Abuse:</strong> Clients may flag inappropriate submissions, but false flagging against earners can result in account restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Respect the privacy of earners. Avoid requesting private information that is not required for task completion.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Security:</strong> Protect your account and project data. Do not share login credentials or payment details with unauthorized individuals.</li>
    <li><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> In case of disagreements, follow platform procedures. Avoid taking issues outside the platform in ways that violate rules or agreements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Clients play a critical role in maintaining a productive and respectful platform. Honest and fair project management ensures a positive experience for all parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Rules for Admins</h2>
  <p>
    Admins are responsible for overseeing the platform, managing disputes, and ensuring compliance with rules. The following guidelines apply:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Admins must remain neutral when resolving disputes between clients and earners.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Admins can suspend or ban users for violations, but decisions should be documented and justified.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All administrative actions should be logged. Users have the right to inquire about decisions affecting their account.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Admins must ensure that platform data, user information, and submissions remain secure and confidential.</li>
    <li><strong>Rule Enforcement:</strong> Admins are responsible for enforcing platform rules consistently and fairly.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Admins must communicate clearly with users regarding issues, suspensions, or feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> Admins should not favor clients or earners in exchange for personal benefits or gifts.</li>
